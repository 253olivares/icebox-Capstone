# ICEBOX APPLICATION 

Senior year project creates for the School Of Informatics and Computing in my Senior year now known as Luddy. 

Unfortunately due to not having access to the Firebase database anymore, the project was created it I no longer have access to live view. 

The project still functions and can still be run by downloading the files installing dependencies if missing and running 

`npm start`

The application utilizes: React, Gatsby, Firebase, & SaSS

The project was built in conjunction with 2 additional contributors. 

The main aim of the project was to create an application that keeps track of refrigerator inventory. Users would enter item information and the application would keep track of the inventory on an online JSON database (Firebase). 

Important Note:
We had no idea of how React worked when we created this program. 2 years later now after reviewing this project I find it to be a miracle we were able to create it with no background knowledge in React.
