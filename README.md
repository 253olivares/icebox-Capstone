#ICEBOX APPLICATION 

Senior project create for the School Of Informatics and Computing in my Senior year. The project is currently not functional and am currently in the process of updating project files and reconstructing the project. 

The application utilizes Gatsby, Firebase, and Sass.

The main aim of the project was to create an application that keeps track of refrigerator inventory. User would enter item information and the application would keep track of the inventory on an online JSON database (Firebase).
